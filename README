Instructions:

Create a 480x800 (24bit) RGB color image in gimp and save as "C source code header".
Edit makelogo.cpp to include the path to the newly created "C source code header" file.

Run the createBootLogo.sh script:
	./createBootLogo.sh

Copy the file into the Kernel's source path:
	cp logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait_custom.h ../Kernel/drivers/video/samsung/logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h

Compile your kernel as usual.

look at end_logo.h if you plan on replacing the charge image.
I never got to just doing it all at once, that would be on my todo list.
