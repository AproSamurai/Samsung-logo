Instructions:

Create a 480x800 (24bit) RGB color image in gimp and save as "C source code header".
Edit makelogo.cpp to include the path to the newly created "C source code header" file.

Build the makelogo binary:
	g++ -o makelogo makelogo.cpp

Chmod the binary to be executable (if necessary):
	chmod +x makelogo

Run the binary and create the header file:
	./makelogo > boot_logo.h

Combine the files to create the needed source file:
	cat boot_logo.h > my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h
	cat charge_logo.h >> my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h

Copy the file into the Kernel's source path:
	cp my_logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h ../Kernel/drivers/video/samsung/logo_rgb24_wvga_portrait.h

Compile your kernel as usual.

look at end_logo.h if you plan on replacing the charge image.
I never got to just doing it all at once, that would be on my todo list.
